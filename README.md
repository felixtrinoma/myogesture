# Myo Gesture

Gesture recognition library for Android.
Work in progressâ€¦

# Setup

Licence files are needed to access Delsys API. Before using the app, you need to place yours in the app assets:

- `MyoGesture/app/src/main/assets/License.lic`
- `MyoGesture/app/src/main/assets/PublicKey.lic`

Check that your Bluetooth is enabled. You might need to restart the app after granting the permissions.

# Training

This part is still experimental, done on a computer for now.

## Create a Python3 environment with Tensorflow

```bash
python3 -m venv myogesture-py3
source myogesture-py3/bin/activate
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy tensorflow
```

## Get your data

Record 2 EMG signals in the train mode, including about 20 times each gesture and periods with noise (nothing, or other gestures that should not be detected).

Labelize those gestures when the data have been recorded by taping on the chart, selecting the correct label and saving. Label noise like gestures (with the "Unknown" label for instance).

The train mode logs every data it acquires to the sdcard. Those logs should be saved in a location like: `/sdcard/Android/data/fr.trinoma.myogesture/files/` or `/storage/0123-4567/Android/data/fr.trinoma.myogesture/files/`.

```bash
adb pull /storage/0123-4567/Android/data/fr.trinoma.myogesture/files/
```

## Run the train script

```bash
python ML/train-model.py files/2019-11-12-13-37-14.dat files /2019-11-12-13-37-14.labels.txt
```

## Put the model in your app assets

The script has generated a `.tflite` file, copy to the assets of the app ` MyoGesture/app/src/main/assets/model.tflite`. Recompile the app and run it, the detection mode, when used with two sensors should display the currently detected gesture.
